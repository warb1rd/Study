# JavaScript Objects Laboratory 

This lab will build upon your knowledge of JavaScript objects and functions. 

There are 8 questions you must complete.

* Q1: Create an object named `obj1` with a property of cat with the value of "cute".

* Q2: Add a property named boo with a value of "moo" on `obj2`. 

* Q3: Add the correct equality operator to make the `isEqual` variable set to `true`.

* Q4: Replace the /*?*/ so the dot and bracket variables are equal to `true`. 

* Q5: Write a function named `reverseProperties` that switches all the properties and values in an object. For example, `reverseProperties({"a": "b", c: "d"})` //=> {"b": "a", d: "c"}. Assume that all input objects have no nesting.

* Q6: Replace /*?*/ with correct values so that `dealerId`, `secondCar`, `managerName` and `numOfInterns` are set to true.

* Q7: Write a function that returns an object where each key is a character in a given string and each value is the number of times that character occurs in the string. For example, `getCharacterNumbers('aab')` will return {"a": 2, "b": 1}. This functions takes a string type and returns an object.

* Q8: Write a method on the person object called hello that when invoked, returns "Hello Jon".
