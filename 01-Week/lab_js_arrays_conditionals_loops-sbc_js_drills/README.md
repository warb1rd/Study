# Super Boring Corporate JS Lab

## Arrays, Conditionals, and Loops

The boss catches you right before you leave your homey cubicle for your cubicle-like home.

**She needs you to write some JS for the company Softball team**. You feel a little bullied, because you're not on the Softball team - Sales cut you after striking out in the first game - but you relent.

She needs it before the next game: tonight! **Can you have it on her desk ASAP?!**

### The Softball Team Full of Buff Sales Jerks 

Follow along with the instructions in the `softball_jerks.js` file provided.

It is separated into 3 parts:

- A. Array Play
- B. Conditional Positional
- C. Loop Troop

Complete all three - run your code in the terminal with node:

`node softball_jerks.js`
