## Daily Standups

- Each Participant Answers Three Questions:
   - What did you accomplish yesterday?
   - What are you working on today?
   - What obstacles/challenges are you faced with?

---
# User Stories

---
### User Stories - _What are they?_
- Key component of the initial planning for an Agile project

- Defines small chunks of _business value_ which can be implemented in a period of days to weeks

- Captures what a user does or needs 

- Commonly formulated by questioning the customer/user

- Often initially written on 3x5 index cards

- NOT a programming To-Do List

---
### User Story Template
#### _As a {user type (role)}, I want {feature} so that {reason}._

>#### As an administrator, I want to approve photos before they are posted so that I can make sure they are appropriate.

---
## User Stories _Example_
>#### As a user, I want to be able to collapse the details of a note so that I can more easily focus on the notes I'm interested in.

---
## User Stories _Example_
>#### As a player, I want to be able to view a list of high scores for inspiration and impress my friends if I make the list.

## Using Trello for AgileUser Stories


- Each _User Story_ will be a Trello _Card_

- The _User Story_ cards can contain:
  - The details for the Story in the _Description_ section
  - Optional: You can document the Point value assigned to complete the story in parenthesis after the _Title_.
  - Use the _Checklist_ to track tasks or steps necessary to complete the story. When creating a checklist, you are given the opportunity to name it.

---
## Using Trello for AgileSetup


- Create a __Board__ for your __Project__

- Real-world projects could have the following __Lists__ organized from left-to-right:
  - __Ice Box__ (aka _Backlog_)
  - __Current__ (aka _Planned_)
  - __Sprint__ (aka _In Progress_)
  - __Done__

---
## Using Trello for Agile - Flow

- __Ice Box__: Put all of your ideas in here to start. Feel free to put in large features (epics) in here until they are broken down into user stories.

- __Current__: Stories that make the cut are put here. You may choose to prioritize your stories from top to bottom. This is also a good place to put cards for bugs to be fixed.

- __Sprint__: This list holds the user stories and bugs currently being developed.

- __Done__: Done obviously holds the completed stories.
