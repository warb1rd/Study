# CALCULATOR LAB

Your challenge is quite simple… build a calculator using HTML, CSS AND JavaScript. This is an opportunity to get more comfortable with JavaScript ***AND*** HTML/CSS. If you feel more comfortable with JS, then use this opportunity to improve your HTML/CSS (and vice versa).

Here are some visual examples:
