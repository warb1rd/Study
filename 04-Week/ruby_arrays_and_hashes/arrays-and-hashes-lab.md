# Ruby Lab: Arrays and Hashes

##### To start:

1. Open up terminal
2. Navigate to/create a folder for W04 D01
3. Create a folder called arrays_and_hashes
4. Create a file called arrays-and-hashes-lab.rb
5. Open with Visual Studio Code
6. Complete the exercises below



##### Notes:

1. To execute the code in your VS Code file, navigate to the directory that holds the file and enter the following command: 

   `$ ruby arrays-and-hashes-lab.rb`

## Exercises

### Exercise 0.

1. Read and re-write all the code below. Make sure to run the code once you have finished writing it to test that it works:

```ruby
pets = [
  {
    name: "Steve",
    type: "dog",
    age: 5
  },
  {
    name: "Calvin",
    type: "snake", 
    age: 2
  }
]
```

2. `puts` a string that reads "My snake's name is Calvin", accessing the elements in the hash
3. Use a loop to increase the age of each pet by 1

**Make sure to `print` or `puts` each step to see the results** 



### Exercise 1.

1. Create this array: `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "strawberry", "mango"]`
2. Write a block that `puts` each fruit (on its own line)
3. Write a block that `puts` each fruit **except** "banana"



### Exercise 2. 

1. Write an array
2. Return the last element in the array, 3 different ways (*use `puts`* to return)
3. Now, return the second to last element in the array



### Exercise 3. 

1. Create this array: `friends = ["Rachel", "Monica", "Phoebe", "Joey", "Chandler", "Ross"]`
2. Find how many friends there are
3. Find how many friends there are whose names start with "R"
4. Sort the friends alphabetically
5. Imagine a world where Chandler and Janice ended up together and she became one of the friends (add "Janice" to the array)
6. Now delete "Janice" from the array (*Phew, back to normal*)



### Exercise 4.

1. Make a hash for yourself: 

   ```ruby
   me = {
     name: "name", 
     age: 0,
     hobbies: [],
     likes_pizza?: true
   }
   ```
2. Add a new key value pair for your birthday.
3. Delete your last hobby (without referring to it specifically)
4. Delete the key/value of your age
5. Change the value of your name to a nickname



### Exercise 5.

1. Create a hash using symbols as keys (:a, :b, :c, :d) and values (100, 200, 300, 400)
2. Use a loop to `puts` a string for each key/value pair: "The value of a is 100"
3. Use a loop to increase the value of each key by 50 and `puts` it
