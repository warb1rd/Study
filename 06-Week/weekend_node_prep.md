### Congrats!

Congrats on completing unit 2!

In our next unit, you will learn about a different backend technology stack: NodeJS, ExpressJS & MongoDB!

You deserve some rest this weekend, but it always helps to get a preview of what lies ahead.

Accordingly, I've selected a couple of videos to watch - it's a little easier to watch than to read when you need a break.

### What are they?

##### NodeJS

NodeJS is an operating environment for executing JS outside the browser.

#### ExpressJS

The most popular web server framework for NodeJS.

### Recommended Intro Videos

>**IMPORTANT: The NodeJS intro video, as many intro videos do, will cover installation - IGNORE THE INSTALL PORTION OF the NodeJS video - you already have it installed!**

Here's a great intro to NodeJS:

I like Will's style, if you do to, here's an intro to Express by him as well:

>Note: Everything you'll see in these videos will be covered in class.  However, if you watch these videos, our job, and yours, become easier because you won't see it in class for the first time :) 

### [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com)

We're leaving Ruby to return to our first love, JavaScript.

In the upcoming unit, we'll be diving deeper into the features of JS, however, since it's been a few weeks, it wouldn't hurt to review the basics of JS - and what better way than by doing a few katas in CodeWars!

__Remember__: If the challenges seem too hard, select the *8th kyu* or *7th kyu* filter, and select *most popular* - these will get you back in the JS groove!
